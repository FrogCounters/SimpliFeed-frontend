      The inspiration and rationale behind <b>SimpliFeed</b> is to help young
      investors like us better obtain financial information through news
      articles by coming up with a solution for the common problems that young
      investors face when trying to stay informed about the financial markets.
      As young investors, we often struggle with information overload, complex
      jargon and a lack of context when reading financial news articles. Hence,
      we hope to come up with an app that can easily identify the most important
      and relevant points in news articles without having to wade through a
      large amount of irrelevant or extraneous information.

      <b>SimpliFeed</b> is a fintech-as-a-service platform that uses natural
      language processing (NLP) to simplify financial articles and make them
      more easily understandable for a younger audience. With <b>SimpliFeed</b>,
      users can access a wide range of financial articles through our website,
      and can easily toggle between the original version and a simplified
      version created by our NLP algorithms. The platform also offers
      personalised recommendations based on users' interests and financial
      goals, helping them to make informed financial decisions. With its
      combination of NLP-powered simplicity and interactive learning tools,
      <b>SimpliFeed</b> is a powerful resource for helping younger audiences
      understand finance and make smart financial decisions.
